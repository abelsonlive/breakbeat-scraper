# breakbeat scraper

In which I scrape a bunch of breakbeats from [https://rhythm-lab.com/breakbeats](https://rhythm-lab.com/breakbeats).

```
git clone git@github.com:abelsonlive/breakbeat-scraper.git
cd breakbeat-scraper/
pipenv install 
python run.py 
```

After awhile you should have a bunch of `wav` files of breakbeats in `breakbeats/`. Enjoy.
